        	<h1>Mapping</h1>
        		<h3>The Good</h3>
        			<h4>https://twitter.com/signup</h4>
        			<p>Twitter has a nice and clear signup form that even offers suggestions if your username is taken. Works well on any screen size.</p>
        		<h3>The Bad</h3>
        			<h4>https://www.airbnb.com/s/San-Francisco--CA--United-States?price_max=840</h4>
        			<p>Airbnb's advanced filters get confusing quickly. The checkboxes for room types are really far from the icon and the caret icons are on the opposite side of the screen from the section which I find a bit misleading.</p>
          </article>

          	<h1>Chunking</h1>
          		<h3>Good</h3>
          		<h4>http://www.reddit.com/</h4>
          		<p>Reddit is a good example of chunking because its a constant flow of posts and combined with Reddit Enhancement Suite allows for endless scrolling so you can go on forever.</p>
          		<h3>Bad</h3>
          		<h4>https://www.yahoo.com/</h4>
          		<p>Yahoo comes out swinging with content left and right overwhelming the visitor with lots of different groups of news articles. Whenever I'm on yahoo I feel like I don't know where to look.</p>

          <article>
          	<h1>Signal-to-Noise Ratio</h1>
          	<h3>Good</h3>
          	<h4>http://lansing.craigslist.org/</h4>
          	<p>Craigslist has no advertisements and only gives you the basics of classified ads.</p>
          	<h3>Bad</h3>
          	<h4>http://milliondollarhomepage.com/</h4>
          	<p>Million dollar homepage is literally just one giant advertising billboard with no organization to the ads or any real flow. The website feels like every pop up ad in existence in one place.</p>
          </article>
          <article>
          	<h1>Hick's Law</h1>
          	<h3>Good</h3>
          	<h4>http://www.autotrader.com/</h4>
          	<p>Auto trader does a good job of starting off with basic choices for you to make about the type of car you are looking for and then expanding on them with easy to understand advanced filtering options.</p>
          	<h3>Bad</h3>
          	<h4>http://espn.go.com/</h4>
          	<p>ESPN has a lot of choices for different sports to keep up with so its tough for them. However there are so many links on the website that it feels like an overwhelming number of choices. Furthermore the navigation once you're in a particular sports section feels dated.</p>

          <article>
          	<h1>Rule of Thirds</h1>
          	<h3>Good</h3>
          	<h4>http://www.apple.com/</h4>
          	<p>Visiting Apple's homepage you are gretted with a very nice picture of the iphone 6 models along with a little header that makes really good use of space.</p>
          	<h3>Bad</h3>
          	<h4>http://www.businessinsider.com/</h4>
          	<p>Business Insider manages misuses the rule of thirds with their side column of headlines that end up just making the website feel cluttered.</p>
